`cargo generate --git https://github.com/jostly/godot-4-rust.git --name "Project name"`

This will create a new directory for the project, based on the project name given with `--name`

Create new Godot project in the `godot` subfolder, with the following options:
- uncheck "Create folder"
- set "Project name" to an appropriate name
- set "Version control metadata" to None (to not overwrite .gitignore)
